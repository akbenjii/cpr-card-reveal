# cpr-card-reveal
reveal opponent's cards in card-jitsu

this is the source code for the exe to download the actual card-revealer, check my youtube video about this. (not released yet)

remeber you need npcap, if you do decide to download this for what ever reason, remember to use electron-rebuild to rebuild cap. 

```
Packaging: 
electron-packager . --platform=win32 --arch=x64 "CPR Card Revealer" --asar --icon="C:\Users\Gues
t1\Desktop\Projects\CPR Card Reveal\src\img\ico-ver.ico"

Then you can turn it into an installer, the end, happy happy. (strongly recommend you just download exe)
```
